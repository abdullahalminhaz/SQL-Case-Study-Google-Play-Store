# üì± Google Play Store SQL Case Study

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Google Play Store dataset using Python and SQL. It demonstrates data cleaning, business insight generation, SQL procedures/triggers, and data exploration to support strategic app development decisions.

## üìä Project Overview

As a market analyst and data specialist, I worked on real-world business questions such as:
- Identifying top-performing app categories.
- Estimating revenue from paid apps.
- Understanding app category distribution.
- Detecting unauthorized price changes using SQL triggers.
- Exploring rating-review correlation.
- Building dynamic tools using SQL procedures.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (for data cleaning)
- **MySQL** (for SQL analysis)
- **SQL Triggers & Procedures**
- **Google Colab**
- **Git & GitHub**

## üßº Data Cleaning (Python)

The raw CSV dataset was cleaned using Python:
- Handled null values
- Standardized column formats
- Prepared data for SQL ingestion

The cleaned dataset was then imported into MySQL using `LOAD DATA INFILE`.

## üîç Key SQL Tasks & Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Categories for Free Apps (Based on Ratings)
EVENTS, EDUCATION, ART_AND_DESIGN, BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE, PARENTING

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Highest Revenue Generating Categories (Paid Apps)
LIFESTYLE, FINANCE, PHOTOGRAPHY

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Percentage Distribution of Apps by Category
Top 5:
- FAMILY ‚Äì 18.65%
- GAME ‚Äì 11.72%
- TOOLS ‚Äì 7.83%
- PRODUCTIVITY ‚Äì 3.75%
- MEDICAL ‚Äì 3.74%

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation: Free vs Paid Apps (Based on Ratings)
Built logic to recommend whether to build paid or free apps category-wise using average rating comparison.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hacker Alert: Track Price Changes Using Triggers
Used SQL Trigger to automatically record price changes into a `PriceChangeLog` table. Helped recover original prices after unauthorized edits.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Genre Splitting with SQL Functions
Split multi-genre values like `'Art & Design;Pretend Play'` into two clean columns using custom SQL functions.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Between Ratings and Reviews
Pearson Correlation Coefficient, r = 0.06
(Slight positive correlation between user reviews and ratings)

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Stored Procedure for Underperforming Apps
Created a stored procedure `checking('category')` that shows apps with below-average ratings for any given category.
